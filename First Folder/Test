Welcome everyone! This is my first test page

It says 'Go' at the top because I wrote 'func' and VSC auto recognized
this as a Go Programming Language and formatted the page as such

Because of this, words like if and func will be different colors as they
are recognized by VSC as Go language and dictates it as such.
